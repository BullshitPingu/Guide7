## Submitting code changes

Simply open a pull request with your changes and describe what you have changed.
In case the code change relates/refers to a GitHub issue please provide the number(s).


## Coding Conventions

Since we all like to read clean code and we use `Dart` as programming language, we use `dartfmt` (Dart format) to format our code.
If you are using an IDE like IntelliJ (or Android Studio) you will have good support for that! Just right click the `lib` folder and call `Reformat Code with dartfmt...`.
It is not vital to the project that anyone is holding onto our coding conventions, since it is an easy fix for every developer, so you do not really need to adhere to the conventions if you don't like to. 
But be prepared that the code will be reformated using `dartfmt` anytime.
